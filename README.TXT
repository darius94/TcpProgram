PROJECT TITLE:TCP Assignment
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To show Interactions between  Server and Client. 
VERSION or DATE: 10/13/2016
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Compile TCPClient first then  TCPServer.
AUTHORS:Darius Little
USER INSTRUCTIONS:

The TCPServer has to be updated with the ip from the computer used.
I would execute with the small file then after I would record with the big file.
It will out the output in the output file.
For each txt file it has to be changed  to Test1-small or Test2-large .
example:
in TCPServer: File file2 = new File("Test1-small.txt")
in TCPClient: File transferFile = new File ("Test1-small.txt");
But once i use the port  it tells me its aready busy so I dont know how to fix it.
So for it to work the ports had to be changed.
